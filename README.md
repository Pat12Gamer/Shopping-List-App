# Shopping-List-App
# This is a project for making a shopping list. This is a document on how to use our shopping list app
# Note: we do not have a system to store the shopping list so once closed the memory will be gone

# So we have a clear instructions on what you can do in the program. Fisrt off all we have 7 options:
#   1. View shopping list
#   2. Add item to shopping list
#   3. Remove item from shopping list
#   4. Check if item is on shopping list
#   5. How many items on shopping list
#   6. Clear Shopping list
#   7. Exit

# You will get a place to right the answer so please click space after you are done

# If you chose option 1, the following will happen:
#   All the items in your shopping list will be displayed
#   If not added, you will be told nothing is there and you can add items by pressing 2 when the menu comes

# If you chose option 2, the following must be done:
#   It will ask you to add an item and press enter. You can add as many times as you like
#   If you wish to stop, type # and press enter.
#   You will get discontinued for adding products and you can use the other options.

# If you chose option 3, the following must be done:
#   The item written in by you will be checked 
#   if it is there, if it is it will be removed 
#   else we will tell you that the item has'nt been added tio the list so do not add that item to your cart

# If you chose option 4, the following must be done:
#   You will type in a word which you wish to check is in the shopping list or not. It will respond accordingly.
